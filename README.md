# KruacentExiled
---

This repo was made for our small (6 players) private SCP:SL server using the Exiled Framework.


## Global Event Framework

the Global Event Framework (GEF) is made to add Global Events which are tweaks in the gameplay which is revealed at the start of each round.

## Blackout 'N Door 
This plugin was made to avoid camping on surface and avoid the sole SCP being stuck.

## Armes (Weapons)
Created new custom weapon will probably renamed it to item when we get item
